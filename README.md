# GraphQL Queries

You have learned the basics of GraphQL. Now it time to test your querying ability.

[Graphql-Pokemon](https://graphqlpokemon.favware.tech/) will be your one stop shop to answer the following questions about select pokemon. It uses [GraphiQL](https://medium.com/the-graphqlhub/graphiql-graphql-s-killer-app-9896242b2125), a tool that helps developers structure their GraphQL queries. Nitro uses GraphiQL too.
